Hi! Thanks for visiting this repo!

This is a very basic website that utlizies JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a basic quiz application. 

You can view it at https://philiplee13.github.io/office_quiz/layout.html

At this point I am still learning more about web developement as a whole, as I learn more I will improve on this website and create more impressive ones as well.
